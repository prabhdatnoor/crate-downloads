Simple webpage to check crates.io package downloads.

# Run
add the package name as param to end of the url, like so (replace curly braces as well):
```
.../index.html?crate={package_name}
```

## Without downloading
just add 'rawgithack.com' to the beginning of the github link:
 
[https://raw.githack.com/prabhdatnoor/crate-downloads/main/index.html](https://raw.githack.com/prabhdatnoor/crate-downloads/main/index.html)
